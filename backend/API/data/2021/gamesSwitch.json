You have freedom in how you pass each day, and as time progresses a natural story plays out that is inspired by yakuza-delinquent aesthetics. This is a story about gangs, friendships, and, most of all, about growing up.\n\nYou can pick fights with other gangs and master the game’s mechanics, utilizing punches, kicks, and grapples while leveling up Ringo and his gang members. You can go shopping, hang out at a burger restaurant or café, head to the bar, or even get a job to earn money for food, activities, a TV, and other goodies that unlock minigames. On top of that, you have classes and homework to consider, as you can strive for top grades or play truant. Above all of this, the story of Ringo Ishikawa plays out for you to experience.\n\nWith stylish retro-inspired visuals and a varied soundtrack to perfectly fit the mood, The friends of Ringo Ishikawa give an awesome blend of narrative, action, varied challenges, and a Japanese vibe.\n\nArrest of a Stone Buddha\nIn Arrest of a stone Buddha, a hitman is searching for an answer in 1970s France.\n\nAs a professional killer, you'll live through November 1976; when taking on enemies you're fast and lucky enough so you don't need to plan your actions too far. You kill with one shot and you never miss. When you run out of ammo you just throw a gun away. You can disarm any enemy and use any weapon; when it's time to get out you just use a vehicle nearby.\n\nYou have an apartment in the historic center of the city. When you want to eat you go to a cafe, and you can visit a museum or a cinema when you're looking for entertainment. And you have a lover when that need arises. Around the intense action, there is the mundane, as you seek to pass your days.\n\nAll along there is an important question that’s longing for an answer.",

In addition, this title has been improved with the G-MODE archives. The \"Arrange\" mode allows you to fly through the air more intensely and smoothly. The game includes two modes: \"Arrange\" mode, which is more intense and smoother, and \"Original\" mode, where you can enjoy the nostalgic graphics of the time. There are eight types of special weapons. Each weapon has its own unique characteristics, and the power of each weapon increases with successive attacks. The thrill comes from the large number of bullets that the enemy attacks with. Use the special attacks to your advantage to defeat the final boss! ■ About G-MODE Archives The G-MODE Archives is a reissue project that faithfully recreates old feature phone games as they were back then. In order to enjoy the app as it was back then, the web-connected menu, buttons, and keys have been transplanted, but some of them may not work.

Compete in championship mode on different tracks, located and designed throughout the entire USA. Drive from north to south, from the coast to the highest peaks. Win the gold cup and raise it over your head at each of them. Any experienced driver can mess up and cause an accident. But don't worry! because you have the option ¬´ flashback ¬ª, which turns back the clock to just before the accident for a new chance, and it's all done in slow motion (bullet time). With several weather settings, each race will always feel different at all times. In training mode, you can practice on an oval circuit with the vehicles that have already been unlocked. Get the best times in the time trial mode and upload them to the world ranking. The challenge is to be number 1 on the world podium among your colleagues, friends or family. Burn! SuperTrucks offers you a passionate and extreme driving experience, with incredible skids and dizzying jumps, where your adrenaline will be through the roof at all times. But don't forget! You yourself are your worst rival."

As you approach your castle, you notice that something is wrong. As you get closer, you will notice that the castle has been occupied by orcs. Your two companions are killed before your eyes by the enemy orc on the castle walls. In a hurry, you go to the back of the castle, where you activate a secret passage known only to family members. You decide, as the heir of the head of the family, to take the castle from the hands of the wicked orcs. Return of the Heir is an adventure-platform game set in a fantasy world. As a young heir, we travel through the nooks and crannies of our family castle in search of missing family members. Additionally, we are trying to recover the treasures stolen by the invaders. On our way there are hosts of orcs, sinister rats, spiders and various traps such as hidden spikes, falling orbs, gargoyles spitting fire or lava holes. Armed only with a bow, you must do whatever it takes to recapture the castle you will wield in the future."

Unfortunately, on his first day of school, he gets caught up in some sudden trouble, and accidentally breaks an expensive-looking statue.\n\nIn order to compensate for the broken statue, the principal orders him and the boy who caused the incident to work for the school’s “Bureau for the Investigation of Special Affairs.”\n\nWhen they arrive at the Bureau’s headquarters, a room situated in the school’s enormous underground library, a girl is waiting for them there with an apathetic look on her face.\n\nThe girl informs the confused pair of the situation: Magic exists in this school.\n\nWhen the clock tower chimes, the “Realm of Night” appears, and merges with the school building. The Bureau’s job is to take care of the supernatural problems that arise. And so, Michiru struggles to protect the school from troublesome magical items known as “Mists”…\n\nA Clockwork Ley-Line: Zanei no Yoru ga Akeru Toki\n\nMichiru and Ushio continue to spend their days solving problems at Tenbinruri Academy as part of the special investigation office, otherwise known as ‘Tokusa’. One day, a foreign girl named Adelheid came to seek their help in looking for her grandmother’s memento. Along the way, will they find out more about the link between the day and night worlds?\n\nA Clockwork Ley-Line: Asagiri ni Chiru Hana\n\nThis is the third game and finale of UnisonShift Blossom’s magic mystery Ley-Line series. The ‘night world’ crumbled and their students vanished. Mitsuyoshi thought that the cause might have been a fire that happened at the school 20 years ago, and began to investigate this incident in order to reunite with his friend Kotarou who had disappeared as a ‘night school student’. Meanwhile, the school principal who had also vanished secretly planned to bring back the night world from the other side. All of the remaining mysteries of the school will finally be brought to light."

She has to find a way to stop the cursed beasts awakened after sleeping for a thousand years and coming to life for reasons unknown. Lost Lands: the Golden Curse is an adventurous hidden object game-quest with puzzles and mini-games scattered through the boundless spaces of the fantasy world – from the volcano valleys to the Druid forest, from the deep caves to the floating islands. One fine day an ordinary good-looking housewife, Susan, while visiting the museum of arts drops by an old looking glass which, for whatever reason, starts to beckon her up. When she touched the looking-glass, Susan was immediately transported into a magical fantasy world of the Lost Lands. She has been known for her heroic deeds as Susan the Warrior there. Susan meets a child named Fiora, and the girl takes Susan to her great-grandfather, Maaron. Susan recognizes the Druid as an old acquaintance. Maaron explains that the village was attacked by a Harpy, the legendary winged beast. The strangest thing is that the demon has been a stone statue in the abandoned old fort for thousands of years. Along with her friends Susan is ready to set forth into a volcano, go to a dungeon and climb floating islands to find out the reason why the Harpy, Naga, the Minotaur and Solidus, one after another, began coming to life from the stone prison and causing chaos in the Lost Lands. Naturally, the creatures must be stopped...…"

The fate of the girls' lives will change dramatically depending on your actions in the game. Online streamers Mio Ikoma, Nana Sakurai and Azusa Shiraishi travel to the locally famous haunted resort, the Hotel Izanami, at Nana's request to shoot a video there. It would be a film shoot at an average haunted location with no particular legend attached. To finish shooting without a hitch and get an end result that was vaguely horror-esque...was all they wanted. During filming, Mio gets separated from the group, and suddenly gets attacked by a mascot costume that has come to life. From that point on, the trapped girls are at the mercy of numerous horrors throughout the hotel. Why is a mascot trying to harm them, and why have they been shut in to the hotel with no escape? Can the three girls escape from the hotel with their lives? A livestream set in an abandoned hotel begins... ■Run from the mysterious mascot chasing you, and escape from the abandoned hotel! While exploring the inside of an abandoned hotel, a mascot swinging a bloody hatchet suddenly appears and starts chasing after the three streamers! When you encounter the mascot, run away quickly, hide yourself, and escape from its pursuit. One hit from the mascot's hatchet will lead to instant death (game over).…"

To that end, the organization has established a series of schools up and down the country. Mihama Academy more-or-less left to rot after its abrupt closure, has been given a new purpose as one such 'specialist training school'. Mihama now entrusts the misfit girls who attend it with guns and live ammunition. Paying their own safety no heed, these students are again and again plunged into dangerous extrajudicial missions - all for the good of the realm. No matter how much life grinds them down, what future awaits these girls, who've themselves chosen the path of the gun? \n \nGrisaia: Phantom Trigger 02 \nA VIP arriving from abroad mysteriously disappears in transit. The SORD team at Mihama Academy is presented with a new mission: finding and recovering him. Whenever they appear to be closing in on this missing \"package\", though, it somehow slips through their fingers. Accompanying them on their mission are two fellow SORD from the Kyousen Sakuragaoka campus - twin sisters, who both help and hinder the crew. There have also been rumors floating around of a daredevil biker named \"Soul Speed\", who tears up the streets at night. Before long, the team's thrilling chase descends into a deathmatch, pushing the combatants to their limits and beyond. Rena and Haruto, meanwhile, are taken on a journey deep into the past, to their first-ever encounter. \n \nGrisaia: Phantom Trigger 03 \nWhile Rena and Maki recover from their injuries, the other SORD members jet off overseas for a school trip. Within moments of their arrival, though, the Mihama gang are pulled into a manhunt for a SORD deserter, assisted by students Sylvia and Velvet of St. Aile's International School. Tohka's the star of the show this time round, but she's wrestling with her own issues - old memories of her parents, and a promise to a friend that she wasn't able to keep... \n“You're right. There's a reason we need to get back... even if it means crawling home on our hands and knees.” \n“Let's meet up again someday... if we're still alive.” \nAnd introducing Sengoku Ayame - Sengoku Ichiru's brother, and a handler at St. Aile's: \n“If taking her in alive's too much of a challenge, just get rid of her - I don't give a damn. I simply want to see this mess cleaned up.” \nWhat answers will Tohka find? \nShe has the truth in her sights... \n \nGrisaia: Phantom Trigger 04 \nKumashiro Megumi (Gumi), recently transferred from St. Aile's International School, has been training hard together with Rena and Maki – now fully recovered from their injuries. With the help of her mentor, Tohka, she's shaping up to be a fine sniper. \nJust as one new student settles in, another has her sights set on joining the girls in Class A, Mihama's elite combat unit. Her name? Sengoku Taiga. Haruto, the team's handler, has one condition for Taiga's transfer: that Chris serves as her supervising officer. \nThe two seem an unlikely pair at first, but after spending some time with little Taiga, Chris soon finds a way to see things from her perspective. \nIt's at that moment that the nation is suddenly rocked by a terror attack on an unprecedented scale. Chris rushes to the scene, aware of what's at stake, but paying no heed to the dangers ahead. \nJust as she did, once before. \n\"This is even worse than we could've imagined...\" \nThe death toll keeps on rising, but SORD are stuck watching helplessly from the sidelines. What destiny awaits Chris, Taiga... and Mihama Academy? \n\"Oh, right... I must have died...\" \nClutching to memories of her long-dead mother, she too prepares for an eternity of slumber... \n \nGrisaia: Phantom Trigger 05 \nA few weeks have passed since SORD successfully resolved the Kitaoka University terrorist incident - albeit with some sacrifices - when Murasaki's older sister Yuuki returns to Japan and returns to Mihama Academy. \nBeing more sociable and capable than her sister, Yuuki immediately befriends the other students and builds a trusting relationship with them. \n\"There's no reason for me to be at Mihama anymore...\" \nAs Murasaki starts questioning her raison d'etre, she reminisces about the time when she first met Haruto. \nA few years earlier... \nLamenting his lack of experience, he had come to her village hidden deep in the mountains in search of new skills. \nHe got to know the Ikoma sisters better and kept up with his training.

            "summary": "Grisaia: Phantom Trigger 01 \nThe goal of SORD is to train a new generation of operatives to defend the country against future threats. To that end, the organization has established a series of schools up and down the country. Mihama Academy more-or-less left to rot after its abrupt closure, has been given a new purpose as one such 'specialist training school'. Mihama now entrusts the misfit girls who attend it with guns and live ammunition. Paying their own safety no heed, these students are again and again plunged into dangerous extrajudicial missions - all for the good of the realm. No matter how much life grinds them down, what future awaits these girls, who've themselves chosen the path of the gun? \n \nGrisaia: Phantom Trigger 02 \nA VIP arriving from abroad mysteriously disappears in transit. The SORD team at Mihama Academy is presented with a new mission: finding and recovering him. Whenever they appear to be closing in on this missing \"package\", though, it somehow slips through their fingers. Accompanying them on their mission are two fellow SORD from the Kyousen Sakuragaoka campus - twin sisters, who both help and hinder the crew. There have also been rumors floating around of a daredevil biker named \"Soul Speed\", who tears up the streets at night. Before long, the team's thrilling chase descends into a deathmatch, pushing the combatants to their limits and beyond. Rena and Haruto, meanwhile, are taken on a journey deep into the past, to their first-ever encounter. \n \nGrisaia: Phantom Trigger 03 \nWhile Rena and Maki recover from their injuries, the other SORD members jet off overseas for a school trip. Within moments of their arrival, though, the Mihama gang are pulled into a manhunt for a SORD deserter, assisted by students Sylvia and Velvet of St. Aile's International School. Tohka's the star of the show this time round, but she's wrestling with her own issues - old memories of her parents, and a promise to a friend that she wasn't able to keep... \n“You're right. There's a reason we need to get back... even if it means crawling home on our hands and knees.” \n“Let's meet up again someday... if we're still alive.” \nAnd introducing Sengoku Ayame - Sengoku Ichiru's brother, and a handler at St. Aile's: \n“If taking her in alive's too much of a challenge, just get rid of her - I don't give a damn. I simply want to see this mess cleaned up.” \nWhat answers will Tohka find? \nShe has the truth in her sights... \n \nGrisaia: Phantom Trigger 04 \nKumashiro Megumi (Gumi), recently transferred from St. Aile's International School, has been training hard together with Rena and Maki – now fully recovered from their injuries. With the help of her mentor, Tohka, she's shaping up to be a fine sniper. \nJust as one new student settles in, another has her sights set on joining the girls in Class A, Mihama's elite combat unit. Her name? Sengoku Taiga. Haruto, the team's handler, has one condition for Taiga's transfer: that Chris serves as her supervising officer. \nThe two seem an unlikely pair at first, but after spending some time with little Taiga, Chris soon finds a way to see things from her perspective. \nIt's at that moment that the nation is suddenly rocked by a terror attack on an unprecedented scale. Chris rushes to the scene, aware of what's at stake, but paying no heed to the dangers ahead. \nJust as she did, once before. \n\"This is even worse than we could've imagined...\" \nThe death toll keeps on rising, but SORD are stuck watching helplessly from the sidelines. What destiny awaits Chris, Taiga... and Mihama Academy? \n\"Oh, right... I must have died...\" \nClutching to memories of her long-dead mother, she too prepares for an eternity of slumber... \n \nGrisaia: Phantom Trigger 05 \nA few weeks have passed since SORD successfully resolved the Kitaoka University terrorist incident - albeit with some sacrifices - when Murasaki's older sister Yuuki returns to Japan and returns to Mihama Academy. \nBeing more sociable and capable than her sister, Yuuki immediately befriends the other students and builds a trusting relationship with them. \n\"There's no reason for me to be at Mihama anymore...\" \nAs Murasaki starts questioning her raison d'etre, she reminisces about the time when she first met Haruto. \nA few years earlier... \nLamenting his lack of experience, he had come to her village hidden deep in the mountains in search of new skills. \nHe got to know the Ikoma sisters better and kept up with his training. As he seeks out the village's \"secret art\", a sudden tragedy befalls them. \n\"I'll never forgive you...!!\" \n\"It's okay... Don't worry... I'm not... going anywhere... I'm here with you...\" \n\"I'm stumped... It's exactly as she said - and there's no way to cut a phantom...\" \n\"Come on. Chin up... Show me your courage...\" \nTheir fateful meeting was also the beginning of a tragic story..."

Aside from choosing the best ship for the job, you’ll need to manage resources usage, choose the best trading or smuggling routes, and even buy your own space stations that will allow you to explore the furthest corners of the galaxy.",

I’ve seen plenty of things labelled as “map” so it probably has many levels. Pretty sure it involves some sort of a gun also? My guess is, it’s most likely one of those retro shooters.

This Skittle game can be played solo against the computer or in local multiplayer. The player throws a stick into the pins. The player's score depends on the number of pins knocked down: If he knocks down a pin, he scores the value of the pin; If he knocks down several pins, he scores the number of pins knocked down (if all the pins knock down, the player scores twelve points); If a pin is not completely down on the ground and is balanced on another pin or on the the throwing stick, it is not counted. Fallen pins are then raised on their feet, numbered facing the throwing area, right where they are and without lifting them off the ground. Thus the configuration of the playing area changes. Each player takes a turn at throwing and as many turns are taken as necessary. The winner is the one who scores exactly 50 points. If this mark is exceeded, the player or team score drops to 25. So as the 50 points are approached, the player must be careful to knock down only the pin(s) that will cause the player to reach the 50 points by value (if only one pin falls) or number (if more than one pin falls). For example, if his score is 48, the player must knock down any two pins…"
